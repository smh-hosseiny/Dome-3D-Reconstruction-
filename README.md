# Dome-3D-Reconstruction
Use GUI to locate your image and run the program. 

## GUI

Use the command below on Matlab command window to run the GUI:

```bash
GUI
```

<img src="images/6.JPG" width="400" height="400">

## Performance

### Input

Specify the path to your image (you can use example images in images folder) and the method of reconstruction.

<img src="images/example1.jpg" width="280" height="320">


### Output

![Fitted profile](images/2.JPG)
![Fitted profile](images/3.JPG)

and finally:

![3D Model](images/5.JPG)

### Experiment
We reconstructed the 3D model of some other domes:


![3D Model](images/E.png)
